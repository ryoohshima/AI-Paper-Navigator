# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AI-Paper-Navigator is a newly initialized project focused on navigating and managing AI research papers. The repository is currently in its initial setup phase with minimal structure.

## Repository Structure

This is a minimal repository containing:
- `README.md` - Basic project identifier
- `.docs/` - Documentation directory containing conversation history
- `.git/` - Git repository metadata

## Development Commands

Currently, no package.json or build system is configured. Future development may require:
- Setting up a Node.js/Python/other runtime environment
- Configuring build and test scripts
- Installing dependencies

## Architecture Notes

The project is in its initial state. The architecture will be determined based on the specific requirements for AI paper navigation functionality that will be implemented.

Key considerations for future development:
- Choose appropriate technology stack (web app, CLI tool, desktop app, etc.)
- Design paper storage and indexing system
- Implement search and filtering capabilities
- Consider integration with academic databases and APIs

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Follow conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Current status: Initial commit completed

## Next Steps

The project requires initial setup decisions:
1. Technology stack selection
2. Project structure definition
3. Core functionality implementation
4. Testing framework setup
